        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I&apos;m Chloe, a Cybersecurity and Network Engineering student at Purdue University. Can often be
          found rocking headphones and Doc Martens while trying new coffee shops.

        <ul className="interests-list">
          <li>
            A jack-of-all-hobbies, currently diving deep into the world of cybersecurity — where curiosity,
            problem-solving, and a love for breaking things ethically collide.
          </li>

            When I’m not poking around in networks or learning something new in security, you’ll probably find me
            learning guitar, reading, drawing, gaming, making oddly specific Spotify playlists, taking photos, or
            knitting and crocheting something cozy. I also have an adorable cat called Toki! 
          </li>
          <li>
            I’m obsessed with the color green, love experimenting with ideas, and believe curiosity is the best skill
            you can have — whether you’re debugging code, defending systems, or just figuring life out.
