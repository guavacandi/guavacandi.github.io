        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I&apos;m Chloe, a Cybersecurity and Network Engineering student at Purdue University. Can often be
          found rocking headphones and Doc Martens while trying new coffee shops.
        </p>
        <ul className="interests-list">
          <li>
            I&apos;m deeply interested in both blue team and red team cybersecurity, with a focus on understanding how systems
            are attacked, defended, and strengthened. I enjoy exploring areas like network security, threat detection,
            vulnerability analysis, and ethical hacking, and learning how offensive and defensive strategies work together
            to create resilient systems.
          </li>

            When I&apos;m not poking around in networks or learning something new in security, you wll probably find me
            learning guitar, reading, drawing, gaming, making oddly specific Spotify playlists, taking photos, or
            knitting and crocheting something cozy. I also have an adorable cat called Toki! 
          </li>
          <li>
            I&apos;m obsessed with the color green, love experimenting with ideas, and believe curiosity is the best skill
            you can have &ndash; whether you are debugging code, defending systems, or just figuring life out.
